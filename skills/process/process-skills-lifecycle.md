# Process: Skills Lifecycle

## Title
Management of Skill candidates from capture to publication.

## Scope
- Identifying new Skill candidates from work results.
- Buffer management via `BACKLOG.md`.
- Promotion of candidates to permanent registry.

## When to Use
- After completing a task that introduced a new pattern, rule, or integration.
- When an existing skill needs splitting or significant updating.

## Key Rules
- **Capture**: Agents must analyze task summaries for reusable patterns.
- **Backlog First**: Never create a skill file directly without human approval; add to `BACKLOG.md` first.
- **Human Gate**: Only the USER can promote a candidate to a file.
- **SSOT**: If a pattern is general, it goes to `skills/`; if project-specific, to `skills-mbb/`.

## Workflow
1) **Analyze**: Review the completed task. Is there something reusable?
2) **Draft**: Add a short entry to the "Candidates" section in the relevant `BACKLOG.md`.
3) **Notify**: Inform the USER about the new candidate.
4) **Wait**: Proceed with file creation only after USER confirms the candidate is ready for "Promotion".
5) **Promote**: Create the `.md` file using `SKILL_TEMPLATE.md` and move the backlog entry to "Archive".
